# Your Global Team Speaks 12 Languages. Your Portal Speaks One. That Costs You $11 Million.

**49% of global executives report annual losses of $8–11M from language barriers. For IT support, the impact is measurable, immediate, and solvable.**

---

Consider this scenario. A Brazilian engineer at your Munich office needs to reset her VPN. Your JSM portal is in English. The form has fields like "Network Segment" and "Authentication Protocol."

She doesn't know the English term for what she needs. She can't express urgency precisely. She types "VPN no work" as the summary and leaves the description blank.

The agent gets the ticket. No context. No details. No sense of urgency. A 5-minute fix becomes a 48-hour cycle of clarification emails across time zones and languages.

This isn't a hypothetical. This is happening in your organization right now, across every language pair, every day. And the cumulative cost is far higher than most executives realize.

## The $8–11 Million Number

The Slator Language Industry Market Report found that **49% of global executives reported annual financial losses of $8–11 million due to language barriers**. Not communication inefficiency. Not cultural misunderstanding. Language barriers — the inability to exchange information accurately across languages.

Additional research reinforces the scale:

- **64% of companies** have lost international deals due to lack of multilingual employees
- **Larger companies with global operations** report losses of **€7–10 million annually** from project delays, misunderstood requirements, and failed negotiations caused by language gaps
- Companies lose up to **7 hours per week per employee** due to miscommunication in multicultural teams

These are not IT-specific numbers. They reflect the total organizational cost. But IT support is one of the highest-frequency touchpoints where language barriers manifest daily — in every ticket, every interaction, every form field.

## The IT Support Language Gap

Language barriers in IT support have a specific, measurable impact on ticket quality and resolution time.

### Ticket Quality Degrades

When a non-native English speaker creates a ticket in English:
- **Summaries are vague** — "laptop slow" instead of "laptop freezes during video calls when connected to external monitor"
- **Descriptions lack technical context** — users can't articulate the sequence of events, error messages, or troubleshooting steps they've already tried
- **Priority and urgency are misrepresented** — the user can't convey that a client demo is in two hours
- **Required fields are filled with guesses** — technical dropdown menus become a random selection exercise

The result is a ticket that tells the agent almost nothing. Resolution requires clarification — across time zones, across languages, often through multiple rounds of communication that each introduce more ambiguity.

### Resolution Time Doubles

Research from ITSM Tools identifies language barriers as a significant factor in IT service desk efficiency, noting that traditional multilingual support approaches are failing to bridge the gap. When agents and users don't share a language:
- Initial triage takes longer (agent must interpret ambiguous descriptions)
- Clarification cycles increase by 2–3x
- Escalations increase (agents escalate when they can't understand the request)
- User satisfaction drops, leading to channel switching (phone, walk-up, shadow IT)

## The Scale of the Multilingual Workforce

The scope of this problem is larger than most organizations recognize:

- **75% of English speakers globally are non-native speakers** — approximately 980 million out of 1.35 billion English speakers
- **96% of conversations involving English** include at least one non-native speaker
- **43% of the global population** (3.3 billion people) speaks two or more languages
- **Over 60% of multinational employees** report that language barriers negatively affect collaboration and productivity

In any multinational organization, the majority of your portal users are not native English speakers — even if your portal is in English. They're writing tickets in their second or third language, losing precision with every sentence.

## Why Hiring Multilingual Agents Doesn't Scale

The traditional solution — hire agents who speak multiple languages — faces three structural problems:

### 1. Cost Premium
Bilingual agents command **5–20% higher salaries** than monolingual counterparts. For a 50-person service desk covering 6 languages, the salary premium alone adds **$150K–$500K annually**.

### 2. Availability
**85% of support managers** report difficulty finding agents who speak more than one language. The talent pool shrinks dramatically when you need specific language combinations (Portuguese + German, Japanese + English, Arabic + French).

### 3. Coverage Gaps
Even with multilingual agents, coverage is never complete. A Portuguese speaker may be available on the day shift but not the night shift. A Japanese speaker might cover IT but not HR. Language coverage becomes a scheduling nightmare that grows exponentially with each additional language.

## The User Experience Impact

Language barriers don't just affect ticket quality. They affect whether users engage with IT support at all.

CSA Research found that:
- **72% of consumers** are more likely to purchase (or in an enterprise context, use a service) when support is available in their language
- **40% will never engage** with a service that isn't in their language
- **74% of consumers** are more likely to remain loyal when post-sales support is available in their native language

For IT service management, this translates directly:
- Users who can't express themselves in the portal **call instead** (3–5x more expensive)
- Users who don't feel understood **stop reporting issues** (invisible problems, growing technical debt)
- Users who feel excluded **adopt shadow IT** (38% cite slow/poor IT response as the trigger)

The case studies are compelling. Wargaming saw an **82% increase in CSAT scores** by eliminating language barriers for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean speakers. Logitech achieved a **58-point NPS increase** for translated support conversations.

## The AI Translation Inflection Point

The economics of multilingual support changed permanently with large language models. Where translation previously required human translators, specialized software, or pre-built language packs, modern AI models natively understand and generate 100+ languages with near-human accuracy.

The adoption is early but accelerating:
- Only **17% of customer service leaders** have fully deployed real-time translation tools (Gartner, 2025)
- Organizations that have deployed see **28% faster case resolution rates**
- Businesses investing in translation are **1.5x more likely** to see revenue increases
- The global language services market is projected to reach **$127 billion by 2032**, growing at 7.6% CAGR

## What Solving This Looks Like in Practice

Consider the same scenario from the introduction, but with a conversational AI layer:

The Brazilian engineer opens the chat on the JSM portal and speaks — in Portuguese:

> "Minha VPN parou de funcionar desde ontem. Ja tentei reiniciar o notebook e nada. Preciso urgente porque tenho uma reuniao com cliente amanha."

The AI:
- **Understands Portuguese** natively — no translation layer, no keyword matching
- **Responds in Portuguese** — the user sees their language, feels understood
- Identifies the request as a VPN/Network issue
- Matches the correct request type in the IT service desk
- Creates the ticket with:
  - **Summary:** "VPN connection failure — not resolved after device restart" (in the company's preferred language)
  - **Description:** Full context from the user's message, properly structured
  - **Priority:** High (user mentioned urgency and a client meeting)
  - All required fields populated correctly

The user speaks their language. The ticket arrives in the agent's language. No translation delay. No lost context. No clarification cycles.

This works for any language combination. Portuguese in, English out. Japanese in, German out. Arabic in, French out. The AI handles the translation as part of the ticket creation process.

## The Business Case for Language

Organizations that invest in language capabilities see measurable returns:

| Investment | Outcome | Source |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Language training programs | 12% revenue increase | Learnship |
| Eliminating language barriers (CJK speakers) | 82% CSAT increase | Unbabel / Wargaming |
| Translated support conversations | 58-point NPS increase | Unbabel / Logitech |
| Multilingual workforces | 43% higher export rates | ZipDo |
| Language barrier reduction | 25% reduction in employee turnover | Learnship |

For IT service management specifically, the ROI compounds: better ticket quality reduces clarification cycles, faster resolution improves SLA compliance, and higher portal adoption reduces the cost of phone and email support.

---

## The Strategic Imperative

Language barriers in IT support are not a cultural issue or a training issue. They are a **data quality issue** with a measurable financial impact.

Every ticket written in broken English is a ticket with incomplete data. Every clarification cycle is wasted labor. Every abandoned portal session is a failure you never see in your metrics.

The technology to solve this exists today. AI models that understand 100+ languages, create structured output in any language, and operate at $0.02–$0.08 per interaction. The question isn't whether to invest — it's how much you're willing to keep paying by not investing.
